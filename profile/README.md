# fsquared-ai

We build **AI-first media systems** and **creative tooling**—from narrative compilers to sovereign automation stacks.

## Current Universe: Everduck 🦆
Everduck is an edutainment universe where:
- **stories are structured data**
- **animation is a compilation step**
- pipelines generate comics, shorts, and machinima

## How to contribute
- Want to pitch a story episode? Use the **Story pitch** issue template.
- Found a bug or want a feature? Use the issue forms.
- Prefer PRs? See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Principles
- **Roles, not tasks**: build systems that replace whole workflows.
- **Reproducibility**: manifests, deterministic inputs, audit trails.
- **Taste + doctrine**: consistent tone, consistent visuals, consistent UX.
