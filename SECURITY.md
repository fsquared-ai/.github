# Security Policy

## Supported projects
Security reports are welcome for all fsquared-ai repositories.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, open a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred) in the affected repo if available,
or contact maintainers via a private channel described in that repo’s README.

## What to include
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any suggested mitigations

We’ll acknowledge receipt and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline as appropriate.
